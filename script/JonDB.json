      "Take the casserole carefully out of the oven and, using a slotted spatula, remove the beef to an ovenproof dish. Cover with foil and keep warm in the oven while you vigorously boil the sauce in the casserole (or pan) on the hob, without a lid, until it has reduced by about half.",

      "For the salad dressing, mix the lime juice, fish sauce and caster sugar in another bowl and dress the vegetables with this.",
